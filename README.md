# Battery Management System (Unfinished)
I started to design this BMS on Altium for a electrical car which was going to participate on a design/efficiency competition in 2018. However my university decided to give up on the car, then I didn't finished the design.
There are just component library and schematic designs (mcu, power, communication protocols, wireless) 
PCB hasn't been started yet.
